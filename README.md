# Static-Pub-website

This is my first STATIC website from 2 years ago made for a school project, to present a Bar in the heart of Budapest. It's prupose was to practise and create a multi site web page and design it with HTML5 and CSS3 in a way that's suitable for the 2019's standards.

The code's language is hungarian.

The was only developed until the day of presentation.
